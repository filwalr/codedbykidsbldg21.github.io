	<h2>What is Bullying?</h2>
	<p>aaaBullying is saying or doing harmful things to someone with the intent of making them uncomfortable. Such as 		         physical and verbal abuse, sexual harassment, slurs, excluding someone from groups, stalking someone on social              media
	</p>
	
	<h2>Why is Bullying Happening?</h2>
	<p> People who bully want attention and theyâ€™re insecure. Many bullies bring anger from at home and target their 		frustration and anger at people in school.  Also, people in school bully because they want to be considered the cool 	person or they are getting a lack of attention from their parents at home, and some people bully because they have been bullied before as well.
