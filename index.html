	<h2>What is Bullying?</h2>
	<p>Bullying is saying or doing harmful things to someone with the intent of making them uncomfortable. Such as 		         physical and verbal abuse, sexual harassment, slurs, excluding someone from groups, stalking someone on social              media

	<h2>Why is Bullying Happening?</h2>
	<p> People who bully want attention and they’re insecure. Many bullies bring anger from at home and target their 		frustration and anger at people in school.  Also, people in school bully because they want to be considered the cool 	person or they are getting a lack of attention from their parents at home, and some people bully because they have been bullied before as well. 
	</p>
	<h2>How does this issue affect society? </h2>
	<p>Kids who are bullied are more likely to have anxiety and depression. It can also affect their academic behavior.
	</p>
	<h2>How can you raise awareness?</h2>
	<p>Talk about it with students, help them understand what bullying is and what it can do to others. And help the students to do what they love</p>
